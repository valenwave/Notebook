# Web Apps
Applications on the web. Some have desktop application versions, but that will not be the focus here. 

# Any.DO
A task list application. I can make different lists to catagorize my to do items.
I can organize my items into differnt columns based on how I want to prioritize them.
I have instant access on all of my devices.
Unlike this notebook which I currently have uploaded on GitHub.
Maybe I should link this Notebook to Dropbox or Google Drive. That's a thought for another time.

# Diigo
Used to have a subscription, but then decided I can live without it.
Currently at my free limit.
I need to clean out the articles here.
The idea of highlighting your notes is interesting. I find that I don't really go back to reference my highlights though.
If I clean it up, I can use it for quick research, while I use my Notebook to organize the research once I finish researching.

# Google Keep
I use this for screenshots.
To get something into the system, it is as quick as pressing CTRL+V.
It's also able to read the words in the images and you can search for those words.
