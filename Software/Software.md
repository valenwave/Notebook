# Software
The programs I use and recommend.

# Any.DO
A task list application. I can make different lists to catagorize my to do items.
I can organize my items into differnt columns based on how I want to prioritize them.
I have instant access on all of my devices.
Unlike this notebook which I currently have uploaded on GitHub.
Maybe I should link this Notebook to Dropbox or Google Drive. That's a thought for another time.
