# Simplenote
I use it to jot things down. It's useful that it syncs with the cloud right away, so I would have access to it on my phone or whatever computer I'm using.
I need to migrate some stuff away from there.
Still useful for notes that I want to keep more private.
Keep things organized by labelling your notes with tags.

# Perks
* Now has Markdown support
* Can link internal documents together.
* Has a great search feature.
