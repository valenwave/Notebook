# Atom
These autocomplete option is annoying. I know there is a way to turn it off, but I would have to research how to do so again.
But I can also try to get used to them. Looks like the trigger is on tab or enter, but if I get used to adding a space to the end of every sentence, I should be fine.

# OneNote Notebook
Used to thought having the strict organization of Notebooks and Sections made things more organized. I now choose the freedom of several nested folders.

# Razer Synapse
# Pace
* 0.025 s (25) - Picking speed, can go faster.
* 0.010 s (15) - Speed typer. Visual Studio can handle it.

# Find and Replace
<Delay>25</Delay>
<Delay>15</Delay>

# Share
* I think I will share these on Google Drive. I like how people can save shortcuts.

# Improvements
* Would love a way to make a flat time for all the delays. But once they all have been converted I can update them quickly with a find/replace. I might be able to find a way to use Atom or Sublime to help with this in the future.
