# Sleep
I Should be sleeping before 11, but I don't get too much time to myself. I feel I need to sacrifice sleep.

# Levi
I'm glad I can use my laptop around Levi now and he won't try to turn it off every opportunity he gets.

# Friends
It's hard rejecting people that wants to catch up with you.
There are some people I don't really see the value on catching up with. And my time is limited with baby.
