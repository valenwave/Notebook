# Holiday lights are OK to go up the day after Thanksgiving.
You can take them down anytime after New Year's Day, but before January 6th—that’s Three Kings Day and the last of the 12 days of Christmas. Even if your lights celebrate a different faith this holiday season, the Black-Friday-to-Three-Kings-Day window is still a great guideline.
