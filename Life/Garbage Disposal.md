Don't overload the disposer; grind no more than about 1 cup of food debris at a time.
Every month, clean the disposal with either a disposal cleaner or a mixture of vinegar, baking soda and hot water.
Do not put grease, egg shells, coffee grounds, starchy foods, plastic or large bones down the disposal.
Avoid putting fibrous vegetables through the disposal grinder. Things like celery stalks or corn husks can clog the garbage disposal motor.
