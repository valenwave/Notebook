# All of You
This is a new puzzler that I thought was interesting. Story happens in panel, but you can manipulate the panels of the story to play out in a different order or to start and time at a different time.
Each level seems to introduce something new. At this point, it's starting to get hard, so I'll only play it if my son wants me to.

# Cut the Rope
Fun classic. Great puzzler.

# Discolored
A game that looks like it runs on the Valve Game Engine. I don't feel like getting into it. 

# Don't Starve
I have the game on the Switch and I think I would rather play it there.
In my experiences, I feel like there are times that you lose and it is beyond your control.

# Exit the Gungeon
As a fan of Enter the Gungeon, there are a lot of references to that game, including the guns and enemies. That helps since the game is a lot of memorization of attack patterns.
I like that it auto-aim and attacks for you while you focus on dodging. It makes it a different kind of game.
In many ways the game is still harder though. The rooms are smaller and there are a lot more going on at once. I find myself caught off guard more often than I did with the original game.
As I'm writing this, I am unable to get past the 3rd boss. The bullets are either too fast or are coming at me in too many directions, so I don't have the time to react.

# Fantasian
A turn base RPG. I don't need to start a new one of those.

# Farm It!
A game my toddler can play. It's fun unlocking things, but eventually, it is just the same game play with just different animals and color variations of existing crops you have already unlocked.
It gets stale after level 20.

# Fruit Ninja
My son likes the game, the objects move too fast for him to slice the fruit though, but I can tell he understands the concept. He knows how to navigate the menu, but maybe some day he'll play it on his own.

# Rayman Mini
Nice temple run type game, that is 2-D and plays like a platformer. It's abilities sets it a bit apart from Mario Run.

# Sasquatch
Great game, and fun to play with my little one. Though I'm probably at the point where it's a lot of repetition and grinding so I'm only going to play it when wants to watch me play.
Last I left off, they gave me the goal of catching all of the fishes in the world and they gave me a guide of what all the fishes are and the kind of time, day, and season the fishes become available. Actually more in depth than Animal Crossing's New Horizon's fishing.  
I also started golfing in that game, but I can tell that in order for me to get better, I'll need to grind for some money for better golf clubs. Which, sure. They're just padding out the game at this point.

# SongPop Party
It plays song clips and as a group see who can guess the song first.
Can be fun if that's what you want to do.

# Story Time
Candy crush with a story and games give you points to do things in the overlay world.
Nothing unique about the game, but if you like Candy Crash, go for it.

# Taiko Pop Tap
Cool that it is on here. Not very interesting as a tablet game.
The experience is having actual toy drums. Plus, the drumming doesn't really make you feel engaged with the same as much as DDR or Rock Band would make you feel.
