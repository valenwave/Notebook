# Duel Links
I enjoy the collecting of the game.
So much of rank mode is decided on the coin toss though. There's no enough time to adapt to how the opponent plays.
It's not fun losing 10 rank games in a row.
It's also frustrating losing to the same tricks over and over again, when it feels like there is nothing can be done in response.

# Fire Emblem Heroes
Lot of characters.
Doesn't really make a difference to collect them.

# Mario Run
The design of the game is great.
I like the accessibility. If you want, you can play on a level on easy and you won't be able to die. You get infinite lives and infinite time.
There's also accessibility with the ticket system. If you start a remix level requiring a ticket, you can end the level any time to get refunded the ticket.
