# Duel Links
I enjoy the collecting of the game.
So much of rank mode is decided on the coin toss though. There's no enough time to adapt to how the opponent plays.
It's not fun losing 10 rank games in a row.
It's also frustrating losing to the same tricks over and over again, when it feels like there is nothing can be done in response. 

# Fire Emblem Heroes
Lot of characters.
Doesn't really make a difference to collect them.
