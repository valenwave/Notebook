Game keeps me on my toes

There's something special with a sword vs. bullet action. Though it sounds unfair, it balances out by making damages from melee attacks to be fatal and dodging to be crucial. I get the same enjoyment from games when it's fast bullets vs slow bullets, when there are bullets everywhere.
