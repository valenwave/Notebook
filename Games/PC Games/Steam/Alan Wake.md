Story is engaging.

# Combat
Combat is interesting. Battles with monsters have two phases. When they are evoked in shadow, you have to shine a light on them until the shadow goes away. Afterwards you can shoot them to kill them.
If the monsters attack you, you can time the attack to dodge.
Game keeps me on my toes
Rewards me for reaction instead of memorization.
There's something special with a sword vs. bullet action. Though it sounds unfair, it balances out by making damages from melee attacks to be fatal and dodging to be crucial. I get the same enjoyment from games when it's fast bullets vs slow bullets, when there are bullets everywhere.
