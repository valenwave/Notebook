# Yu-Gi-Oh! Legacy of the Duelist
Graphics could use some work, but it's fun collecting cards and trying to figure how the developers wants you to use the cards.
Wish there was a rarity system in the game. It would help me decide what to include my deck, but I guess without it, I'm encouraged to use cards based on their effects and status instead of their rarity.
