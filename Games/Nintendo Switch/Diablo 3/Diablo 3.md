# Diablo 3
There's nothing left to gain. I can get slightly stronger, but the play style doesn't change much.

# Season
Season 24 starts this Friday, July 23.
There's not really anything left I need to do in-between seasons.
It's great having friends from previous seasons. Even after just 24 hours, I see my friends get to max difficulty

## Reasons to play a season
Things slightly changes every season.
Guarantee set for your class.
Free Primal weapon when you get to a certain point in Greater Rifts.  
I'll probably stop as soon as I get my Primal item
