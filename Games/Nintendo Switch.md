# Switch
Great portable handheld device. Nintendo is limiting though. The Steam Deck should be interesting.

# Diablo 3
There's nothing left to gain. I can get slightly stronger, but the play style doesn't change much.

# Paper Mario Origami King
It was fun. I like the art direction.
I like that leveling wasn't important.

## Leveling
It's interesting how removing leveling liberates you from feeling the need to fight every monster. It was anti-grind.
