# GitHub
I don't do enough projects to warrant the paid subscription.
I need to clean out my repositories.

# Resources
[Wayback Machine](http://web.archive.org/)

# Pinterest
I miss the days when Pinterest would only show me people I follow on my home feed.
I also miss when I could pin and find pins about anything I wanted.

[Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/dashboard/overview)
Looks like I already have some repositories here.
Can't seem to clone from work PC. I either did something wrong, but there's a firewall block. I'll have to try it from home.

# Facebook
Is Facebook still relevant? I'm starting to think not.
But I guess it's also the stage of my life.
I'm not meeting as much people I used to when I was in college or when I was single.
And I don't intend to add my co-workers as Facebook friends.
