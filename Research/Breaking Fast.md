Below are some foods and beverages you can consume while fasting.
* Water. Plain or carbonated water contains no calories and will keep you hydrated during a fast.
* Coffee and tea. These should mostly be consumed without added sugar, milk, or cream. However, some people find that adding small amounts of milk or fat can curb hunger.
* Diluted apple cider vinegar. Some people find that drinking 1–2 teaspoons (5–10 ml) of apple cider vinegar mixed into water can help them stay hydrated and prevent cravings during a fast.
* Healthy fats. Some people drink coffee containing MCT oil, ghee, coconut oil, or butter during their fast. Oil breaks a fast, but it won’t break ketosis and can tide you over between meals.
* Bone broth. This rich source of nutrients can help replenish electrolytes lost during long periods of only drinking water.
