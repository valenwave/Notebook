# Shredded Paper
Don't. Shredded paper placed into paper bags and into the recycling cart results in those bags opening or tearing, which causes the shredded paper to become mixed with other recyclables.  Therefore, the shredded paper becomes uncapturable and constitutes a contaminate to those other materials.

# Keep It Loose
The bagged recycling often gets thrown away because the automated system is unable to tear open the bag(s) to access the materials.
