Used to thought having the strict organization of Notebooks and Sections made things more organized. I now choose the freedom of several nested folders.

# Atom
These autocomplete option is annoying. I know there is a way to turn it off, but I would have to research how to do so again.
But I can also try to get used to them. Looks like the trigger is on tab or enter, but if I get used to adding a space to the end of every sentence, I should be fine.

# SimpleNote
I use it to jot things down. It's useful that it syncs with the cloud right away, so I would have access to it on my phone or whatever computer I'm using.
I need to migrate some stuff away from there.
