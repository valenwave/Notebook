# .NET Framework Advantages
If you’re a .NET developer who needs to build and release something fast and you don't have time to learn .NET Core, then the .NET Framework is your choice. .NET Core does have a learning curve.

If you’re maintaining and upgrading existing .NET apps, .NET Framework is your choice. Porting an existing .NET app to a .NET Core app requires some work.

.NET Framework is what it is. The current version of .NET Framework, 4.8, is supposed to be the last version of .NET Framework. There will be no more new versions of .NET Framework planned in the future.

# .NET Core Advantages
If you’re building a new application and have a choice between .NET Core and .NET Framework, .NET Core is the way to go.

Microsoft just announced .NET Core v 3.0, which is a much-improved version of .NET Core. If you want to learn and build for the future, .NET Core is the way.

.NET 3.0 now supports WPF and Windows Forms. .NET Core 3.0 also supports cross-development between UWP, WPF, and Windows Forms. This provides developers the flexibility to bring modern interfaces of UWP into Windows Forms and WPF.

If you’re building a new app and your company has approved it, .NET Core is the way to go. .NET Core will continue to get better and better.

Cross-Platform: .NET Core is better suited for cross-platform needs. .NET Core apps are supported on Windows, Linux, and macOS. Microsoft’s popular open-source code editor, Visual Studio Code, is supported on Windows, Linux, and macOS. VS Code supports the modern needs of code editors including IntelliSense and debugging. Most third-party editors, such as Sublime, Emacs, and VI, work with .NET Core.

Performance & Scalability: Performance and scalability were the two major key focus areas when .NET Core was developed. .NET Core and ASP.NET Core are the top-performing web frameworks according to some benchmarks.
